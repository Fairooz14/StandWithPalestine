Along with the physical invasion of Palestine, Israel occupation is also going crazy with it's cyber attacks, and more: cutting of electricity, internet and water.
Here is a list of simple, yet effective counter-measures:

1. Change passwords on mail, social accounts, etc.
2. Use a password manager, to ensure your passwords are not reused
3. Enable 2FA (two-factor authentication) where possible
4. Create an additional channel of communication with important contacts (i.e. Signal/Slack/Teams/Telegram) instead of websites that block Palestinian content like Meta (Facebook, Instagram, etc).
